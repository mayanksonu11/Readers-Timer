1. What is this?\n
-> This is a python program which gives you a increasing target time in which you should be reading. You even get a break after your target time is completed.

2. How does it know whether I am reading or not? 
-> For now you just have to be honest to yourself and programme. The programme ask for it at the end of break of your target time.

3. So how is it a challenge?
-> As you complete reading in one target time slot you get a break and after that a feedback question is asked and depending on your response you get next time slot. Let's see how far you can go.

4. It asks for initial time, what is that?
-> Basically it asks you to choose a time which you think you can read.

5. What are future updates in this work?
-> The idea is to incorporate mouse movement detection and app-in-focus to automatically conclude whether you were actually reading or not.
